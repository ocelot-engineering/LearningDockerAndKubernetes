# Learning Docker and Kubernetes

This repo is working for the course [Docker and Kubernetes - The Practical Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-kubernetes-the-practical-guide/).

Please note that much of the code used in exercises was provided by the course and not written by the author of this repo. Nevertheless, it has been included for completeness and so the exercise solutions are reproducable.

The repo is not useful to anyone but the author.

Note that lessons 10 and 11 did not include any code, hence they are missing from this repo.
